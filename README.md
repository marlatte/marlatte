### 👋 Hi there

I'm Walker, a Full Stack Software Developer 👨‍💻 


I built [BranfordVolunteers.org](https://www.branfordvolunteers.org/) on behalf of [Antonym Partners](https://antonympartners.com/) and the Branford Community Foundation.
<br> The platform created a much-needed place for nonprofits to publicize their openings and for volunteers to find opportunities.


### 💼 My Background

I have a degree in International Politics and studied web development with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
