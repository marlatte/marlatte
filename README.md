### Hi there 👋

I'm a JavaScript developer! I have a degree in International Politics and learned to code through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 

I also enjoy:
- Making music 🎸 🥁 🎤
- Learning languages 🇪🇸 🇷🇺 🇮🇹 🇧🇷 🇩🇪 
- Designing logos and layouts 🖼️ 🖍️
- Tearing my hair out over soccer ⚽️ 🛡️

### My Work

I built [BranfordVolunteers.org](https://www.branfordvolunteers.org/), a place for nonprofits to <br /> publicize their needs and for volunteers to find opportunities, <br /> on behalf of [Antonym Partners](https://antonympartners.com/) and the Branford Community Foundation.
